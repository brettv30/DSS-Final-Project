# DSS-Final-Project
A final project where we are creating Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Dimensional Data Models in Erwin Data Modeler, then generating a physical database (I am using mySQL), then going through the ETL process with various CSV files, then creating two Tableau Dashboards on top of the database.
